      <h1>To My Dearest Hedy ðŸ’Œ</h1>
      <p>Thank you for everything â€” for loving me unconditionally, for accepting me just as I am, for making me happy, and for helping me become the best version of myself.</p>

      <p>I'm really in love â€” deeply in love â€” with the fact that you're my everything. You're my partner, the one I'll share everything with, and the person I'll lean on when the stormy days come.</p>

      <p>I love you so much, my Hedy, my babygirl, my sweet little young babygirl. You have all of me, always. I'll always be here, pouring my heart out to you and making sure you feel safe.</p>

      <p>Surprises are for later, okay? Sleep well for now. Hehe.</p>
